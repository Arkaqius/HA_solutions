class RecoveryManager:
    """
    Manages the recovery processes for faults within the safety management system.

    This class is responsible for executing recovery actions associated with faults. It acts upon
    the specified recovery actions by invoking callable functions designed to mitigate or resolve
    the conditions leading to the activation of faults. The RecoveryManager plays a critical role
    in the system's ability to respond to and recover from fault conditions, thereby maintaining
    operational integrity and safety.

    The RecoveryManager is designed to be flexible, allowing recovery actions to be defined as
    callable functions with associated additional information, facilitating customized recovery
    strategies for different fault scenarios.

    def recovery(self, recovery_action : Callable, additional_info):
        """
        Executes a specified recovery action with the given additional information.

        This method invokes a recovery action â€” a callable function designed to address or mitigate
        a fault condition. The additional information provided can include context or parameters
        necessary for the recovery action to effectively resolve the fault.

        Args:
            recovery_action (Callable): A callable function that embodies the recovery logic for a fault.
                This function is expected to take a single argument: `additional_info`, which contains
                context or parameters relevant to the fault condition.
            additional_info (dict): A dictionary containing additional details or parameters necessary for
                the execution of the recovery action. The structure and contents of this dictionary are
                dependent on the specific requirements of the `recovery_action` callable.

        Note:
            The recovery process is critical to the fault management system's ability to respond to and
            mitigate fault conditions. It is essential that recovery actions are defined with careful
            consideration of the fault scenarios they are intended to address.
